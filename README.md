This is the big one, my very own idea, and I'll likely never finish, but that is by design. I'll probably overwrite this README many times over, but as of right now, the concept is simple.
This will be a social media site/app for tricksters, or object manipulators, or skill toy enthusiasts, whatever you want to call them.
Name undecided.
This site/app will be for them. At first, just a TikTok for tricksters.
The grandiose idea is that it can be a way for people to claim 'ownership' of tricks, like, hey, I did that first, and I uploaded it here, so I'm the founder now.
Although my belief is that all tricks already existed, so nobody is 'inventing' tricks. We are just finding them. I still think it would be fun to have, like, a common resource for finding WHO did the tricks first.
Now, this idea is way beyond my skillset as of today, but the intention is to continuously learn and grow into that idea. So, organizing the early mindset, I think, is important.
More than likely, this will turn into my greatest portfolio project for some job down the line.
