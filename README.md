This is the big one, my very own idea, and ill likley never finish, 
but that is by design. ill prolly overwright this readme many times over,
but as of right now the concept is simple.

this will be a social media site/app for tricksters.
or object manipulators.
or skill toy enthueists. whatever you wanna call them.
name undecided
this site/app will be for them.
at first just a tiktok for tricksters
the grandious idea is that it can be a way for people to 
claim 'ownership' of tricks.
like hey i did that first and i uploaded it here so im the founder now.
although my beleif is that all tricks already existed, so nobody is 
'inventing' tricks. we are just finding them. i still think it would 
be fun to have like a common resource for finding WHO did the tricks first.
now this idea is way beyond my skillset as of today, but the intention is 
to continouslly learn and grow into that idea. so orginizing the early mindset 
i think is important.

now more than likey this will turn into my greatest portfolio project for some job down the line
but how cool would it be if this is the linus torvalds story of the trickster world.
